# Voicecloning

> This repository provides a seamless "all-in-one" solution to clone any voice found on YouTube. By simply providing a URL, the application extracts the audio, uses AI to transcribe the speaker's unique speech patterns, and allows you to generate new dialogue in that exact voice.

## ✨ Features

- **Voice Cloning from YouTube**: Extract audio from YouTube URLs and clone voices using AI
- **AI-Powered Transcription**: Automatically transcribe and analyze speech patterns
- **Character Voice Generation**: Generate new dialogue in cloned voices
- **SpongeBob Character Support**: Pre-configured for Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Sandy, and SpongeBob voices
- **Reference Text Management**: Organized reference texts for accurate voice cloning
- **Generation Output Storage**: Save and organize generated voice samples

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster processing)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devMuniz02/VoiceCloning.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd VoiceCloning

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Usage

### Running the Web Interface

```bash
# Run the Gradio web application
python app.py
```

This will start a local web server where you can:
- Input a YouTube URL to extract voice samples
- Generate new dialogue in cloned voices
- Choose from pre-configured SpongeBob characters

### Command-Line Voice Cloning

```bash
# Run the voice cloning script for a specific character
python clone.py
```

Modify `clone.py` to change the `VOICE_NAME` variable for different characters:
- spongebob
- mrkrabs
- sandy
- patrick

### Advanced Usage

The application uses:
- **Whisper**: For audio transcription and speech analysis
- **Qwen TTS**: For voice synthesis and cloning
- **yt-dlp**: For YouTube audio extraction
- **Gradio**: For the web interface

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the following in `clone.py`:
- `VOICE_NAME`: Choose from "spongebob", "mrkrabs", "sandy", "patrick"
- `SOURCES`: Dictionary containing YouTube URLs and time ranges for each character
- Model size in `app.py`: Choose between "0.6B" and "1.7B" models

Reference text files are stored in `voices/{character}/{character}_reference_text.txt` and can be customized for better voice cloning accuracy.
